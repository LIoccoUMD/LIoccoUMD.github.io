  title: About Me
  summary: |
    I specialize in Python development, data analysis, and machine learning, with experience building automated workflows,
    predictive models, and interactive dashboards that turn complex data into clear, actionable insights. My background includes leading development
    projects, streamlining data processes, and collaborating across teams to improve efficiency and deicision-making.

    Outside of work, I enjoy tackling side projects that blend problem-solving with creativity. I like to experiment with small
    scale automation tools and new technologies. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and apply my skills in a dynamic
    environment.

    *** This was in education details but it doesn't show up on screen? ***

      During my time at the UMD I was exposed to a multitude of tools. Because of this, I 
      am confidently able to quickly adapt to a new environment.

      My studies at the University of Maryland, College Park,
      honed my skills in information science and data management, focusing on programming,
      statistical analysis, and ethical data use. I gained expertise in designing databases,
      developing web applications, and applying user-centered design. Through coursework
      in computing infrastructure, security, leadership, and advanced data science,
      including machine learning, I built a strong foundation for creating innovative,
      responsible solutions to complex data challenges.
